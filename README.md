Modern agriculture demands precise genomic prediction to accelerate elite crop breeding, yet traditional genomic prediction approaches, such as genomic best linear unbiased prediction (GBLUP) and Bayesian methods, focus primarily on the cumulative effect of individual SNPs, thus neglecting the concerted influence that the surrounding sequence context has on the phenotype. To overcome these limitations, we propose two novel feature embedding modes (SNP-context and whole-genome) based on DNABERT-2, a cross-species genomic foundation model that uses self-attention mechanisms and transfer learning to automatically identify conserved sequence features across diverse evolutionary lineages without prior biological assumptions.
